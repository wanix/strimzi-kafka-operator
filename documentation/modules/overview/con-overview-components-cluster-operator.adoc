= Cluster Operator

[role="_abstract"]
Strimzi uses the Cluster Operator to deploy and manage clusters.
By default, when you deploy Strimzi a single Cluster Operator replica is deployed. 
You can add replicas with leader election so that additional Cluster Operators are on standby in case of disruption.  

The Cluster Operator manages the clusters of the following Kafka components:

* Kafka (including Entity Operator, Kafka Exporter, and Cruise Control)
* Kafka Connect
* Kafka MirrorMaker
* Kafka Bridge

The clusters are deployed using custom resources.

For example, to deploy a Kafka cluster:

* A `Kafka` resource with the cluster configuration is created within the Kubernetes cluster.
* The Cluster Operator deploys a corresponding Kafka cluster, based on what is declared in the `Kafka` resource.

The Cluster Operator can also deploy the following Strimzi operators through configuration of the `Kafka` resource:

* Topic Operator to provide operator-style topic management through `KafkaTopic` custom resources
* User Operator to provide operator-style user management through `KafkaUser` custom resources

The Topic Operator and User Operator function within the Entity Operator on deployment.
