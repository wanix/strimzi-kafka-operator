= Topic Operator

[role="_abstract"]
The Topic Operator provides a way of managing topics in a Kafka cluster through `KafkaTopic` resources.
The Cluster Operator can deploy the Topic Operator as part of the *Entity Operator* configuration at the same time as a Kafka cluster.
The operator can also be deployed standalone to help manage topics for Kafka clusters not operated by Strimzi.

.Example architecture for the Topic Operator

image:topic-operator.png[The Topic Operator manages topics for a Kafka cluster via KafkaTopic resources]

The Topic Operator manages Kafka topics by watching for `KafkaTopic` resources that describe Kafka topics, and ensuring that they are configured properly in the Kafka cluster.

When a `KafkaTopic` is created, deleted, or changed, the Topic Operator performs the corresponding action on the Kafka topic.

You can declare a `KafkaTopic` as part of your application's deployment and the Topic Operator manages the Kafka topic for you.
