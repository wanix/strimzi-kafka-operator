= Configuring logging levels

[role="_abstract"]

WARNING: Strimzi operators and Kafka components use log4j2 for logging.
However, Kafka 3.9 and earlier versions rely on log4j1.
For log4j1-based configuration examples, refer to the link:{DocArchive}[Strimzi 0.45 documentation^].

Configure the logging levels of Kafka components and Strimzi operators through their custom resources.
You can use either of these options:

* Specify logging levels directly in the `spec.logging` property of the custom resource.
* Define logging properties in a custom `ConfigMap` and reference it using the `configMapKeyRef` property.

Advantages of using a `ConfigMap`:

* Centralized maintenance
* Reusable with multiple resources
* Flexibility to append logging specifications to add filters

Specify a logging `type` in your logging specification:

* `inline` when specifying logging levels directly
* `external` when referencing a `ConfigMap`

For `inline` configuration, use the `loggers` property to set the root logger level and levels for specific classes or loggers.

.Example inline logging configuration
[source,shell,subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
# ...
logging:
  type: inline
  loggers:
    rootLogger.level: INFO
# ...
----

For `external` configuration, use a `ConfigMap` to define logging configurations using a full `log4j2.properties` file. 
Set the logging `name` and `key` properties to reference the `ConfigMap`. 
Both properties are mandatory. 

.Example external logging configuration
[source,shell,subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
# ...
logging:
  type: external
  valueFrom:
    configMapKeyRef:
      name: my-config-map
      key: log4j2.properties
# ...
----

Default logging is used if logging is not specified in the resource using either method.
Loggers that haven't been explicitly configured inherit settings from their parent loggers. 

When a resource managed by the Cluster Operator is created, a `ConfigMap` with the specified logging configuration is also created. 
For components managed by the Strimzi operators, changes to logging levels are applied dynamically.

WARNING: Setting a log level to `DEBUG` or `TRACE` may result in a large amount of log output and may have performance implications.

== Configurable loggers

The following Kafka components and operators have specific loggers available for configuration:

* link:{BookURLConfiguring}#property-kafka-logging-reference[Kafka loggers^]
* link:{BookURLConfiguring}#property-kafka-connect-logging-reference[Kafka Connect and MirrorMaker 2 loggers^]
* link:{BookURLConfiguring}#property-kafka-bridge-logging-reference[Kafka Bridge loggers^]
* link:{BookURLConfiguring}#property-cruise-control-logging-reference[Cruise Control loggers^]
* xref:ref-operator-cluster-logging-configmap-str[Cluster Operator loggers]
* link:{BookURLConfiguring}#property-topic-operator-logging-reference[Topic Operator loggers^]
* link:{BookURLConfiguring}#property-user-operator-logging-reference[User Operator loggers^]
