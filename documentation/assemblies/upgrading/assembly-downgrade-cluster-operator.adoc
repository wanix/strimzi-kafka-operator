== Downgrading the Cluster Operator returns Kafka version error

If you downgrade the Cluster Operator to a version that does not support the current version of Kafka you are using, you get an _unsupported Kafka version_ error.
This error applies to all installation methods and means that you must downgrade Kafka to a supported Kafka version.
Change the `spec.kafka.version` in the `Kafka` resource to the supported version.

You can use `kubectl` to check for error messages like this in the `status` of the `Kafka` resource.

.Checking the Kafka status for errors
[source,shell, subs=+quotes]
----
kubectl get kafka <kafka_cluster_name> -n <namespace> -o jsonpath='{.status.conditions}'
----

Replace <kafka_cluster_name> with the name of your Kafka cluster and <namespace> with the Kubernetes namespace where the pod is running.
